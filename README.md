# Tools & Technologies used

  - `AngularJS v1.7.6` as I have prior experience of working with Backbase widgets in AngularJS 1.x versions
  - `Karma v4.0.0 & Jasmine v3.3.0` For unit testing the application

# Components Created

  There are 2 components created for the application:
  
  - `transfer-amount` This is the component where the user enterers the **merchant name** to whom the transfer needs to be done and the **amount** that needs to be debited
  - `transactions-list` This is the component where the user can view all the transactions that have happened. Any new transaction that the user does will be added to this list. The other implemented features implemented here are: **searching** on press of the keystroke and **sorting** on date, beneficiary and amount. The sorting order persists even if a new transaction is done.

# Responsiveness Support
  
  The application has been tested for the below mentions devices for both `portrait` and `landscape` orientations:
  
  - `Apple Macbook 15'`
